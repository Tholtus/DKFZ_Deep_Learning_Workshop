## Exercises for Session 1:

1.) [Python and Numpy Basics](https://github.com/Tholtus/DKFZ_Deep_Learning_Workshop/blob/master/coding_excercises/Python_Basics.ipynb):
  	  Get familiar with Python, Jupyter Notebook and Numpy. Learn about [Python Broadcasting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html) and try to avoid for loops; use vectorization instead!

2.) [Build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats](https://github.com/Tholtus/DKFZ_Deep_Learning_Workshop/blob/master/coding_excercises/Neural_Network_Training.ipynb). (Slides 15-17 as reminder)

3.) [Create an image dataset through Google Images](https://github.com/Tholtus/DKFZ_Deep_Learning_Workshop/blob/master/coding_excercises/download_own_dataset.ipynb) and train your own Deep Learning Image Classifier. 
(Check [Lesson Notebook](https://github.com/Tholtus/DKFZ_Deep_Learning_Workshop/blob/master/lesson_notebooks/1_pets.ipynb) and slide 22)
